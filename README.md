# Arduino-Voting-Machine

## Implemented using Arduino Technology using Tinkercad for easy and virtual stimulation. 
## This system avoids rigging of votes and saves time and human effort.

### Components :

### 1) Arduino Uno R3


The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc . The board is equipped with sets of 14 digital and 6 analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits. It is programmable with the Arduino IDE  via a type B USB cable.It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery.

### 2) LCD 16x2


It is a flat-panel display or electronically modulated optical device that uses the light- modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. 

### 3) BreadBoard Small


It is a construction base for prototyping of electronics.This makes it easy to use for creatingtemporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design.

### 4) Potentiometer


It is a type of position sensor.It works by varying the position of a sliding contact across a uniform resistance.

### 5) Resistor - 250 kilo Ohms


To reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements and terminate transmission line.

### 6) Pushbuttons


Simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process.

### 7) Jumper Wires


To interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components.
